# JPG-to-PNG-Converter
A project that converts JPG files into PNG files from the terminal.
This is my very first project made.

To initialize you must run it on the terminal
  >python3 JPEGtoPNGconverter.py pokedex/ png_converted/
Note:
  1. You must have the folder of images to convert inside the project 
  2. Each folder must have forwardslash right after and no space ex. "this_folder/"
  3. Each argument is separated by a space ' ' 
  4. After all that you will have a new folder {whatever name you gave it} containing png files

Examples of how it should look:
1.
    python3 JPEGtoPNGconverter.py JPEG_files/ PNG_files/
2.
    python3 JPEGtoPNGconverter.py images/ converted_images/
2.
    python3 JPEGtoPNGconverter.py random_images/ png_images/
